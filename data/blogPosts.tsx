        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. First Impressions Matter</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          In today&apos;s digital-first world, your website is often the very first impression
          people get of your business. It serves as your online storefront, and if it&apos;s slow,
          outdated, or difficult to navigate, visitors may assume your services or products are the
          same. A modern, well-designed site signals to users that you care about quality, attention
          to detail, and user experience — all factors that build immediate trust.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Credibility and Trust</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Studies show that users judge a business&apos;s credibility based on its website within
          seconds. Without an online presence, potential customers may question whether your
          business is legitimate. A professional site, especially one with clear contact
          information, testimonials, and service descriptions, helps establish trust. It reassures
          users that they&apos;re dealing with a real, reputable company.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Reach a Wider Audience</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Unlike physical storefronts that close at night or operate within certain regions,
          websites are open 24/7 and accessible globally. This allows you to reach potential
          customers beyond your local area, expand into new markets, and accommodate different time
          zones. Whether someone visits your site at 2 PM or 2 AM, they can learn about your
          business, browse offerings, or submit a contact form — all without your intervention.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Drive More Sales</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          A well-structured website acts like a 24/7 sales agent. With clear calls to action,
          persuasive copy, and optimized user journeys, you can guide visitors toward conversions —
          whether that&apos;s scheduling a consultation, buying a product, or signing up for a
          service. Integrating analytics helps you understand what pages convert best and what users
          are searching for, giving you the power to continually improve performance and increase
          revenue.

          Bill Gates
        </blockquote>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. SEO and Visibility</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Your website isn&apos;t just a digital brochure — it&apos;s a powerful marketing tool.
          With effective SEO (Search Engine Optimization), your business can show up in Google
          search results when people look for services or products you offer. That visibility is
          invaluable, especially when combined with local SEO tactics like Google Business Profile
          integration, reviews, and schema markup. The result: more traffic, more leads, and more
          growth.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-10 font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          The bottom line? A website isn&apos;t a luxury — it&apos;s a necessity. Whether
          you&apos;re a local service provider or a growing startup, a strong online presence is
          your foundation for long-term success.

      <>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. End-to-End Control</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          One of the biggest advantages of full stack development is the ability to manage both the
          frontend and backend of a web application. This holistic approach enables developers to
          ensure consistency across the stack, from database design and server logic to the user
          interface and client-side experience. With a unified development strategy, businesses can
          reduce miscommunication, speed up project timelines, and maintain a higher standard of
          quality.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Cost Efficiency</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Hiring a full stack developer is like having two professionals in one. Instead of
          onboarding separate teams for frontend and backend, companies can rely on a single expert
          to oversee the entire development cycle. This reduces payroll costs, minimizes onboarding
          complexity, and ensures a seamless integration between both ends of the application — a
          win-win for startups and growing businesses alike.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Rapid Prototyping</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Time-to-market is everything. Full stack developers are uniquely positioned to quickly
          spin up MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) that allow businesses to test, validate, and
          improve ideas without major upfront investment. This agile approach reduces development
          bottlenecks and empowers teams to pivot based on feedback or changing market needs.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Better Problem Solving</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          A full stack developer has visibility into how each layer of the system interacts,
          allowing them to diagnose bugs more effectively and optimize the system as a whole.
          Whether it&apos;s a performance bottleneck in the backend or an issue with UI rendering,
          full stack devs can trace the root cause faster and implement solutions that work across
          the board.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Streamlined Communication</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          When a single developer (or small full stack team) handles a project, the communication
          gap between frontend and backend disappears. There&apos;s no need for long handoff
          documents or inter-team coordination delays — everything is streamlined. That means faster
          development cycles, more efficient sprints, and greater clarity in decision-making.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Future-Proofing Your Team</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The demand for full stack developers is on the rise — and for good reason. As technologies
          evolve, having developers who are comfortable working across the entire application stack
          offers a level of adaptability that&apos;s crucial in today&apos;s fast-paced digital
          economy. They&apos;re more likely to stay relevant, upskill continuously, and lead
          cross-functional teams effectively.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 my-8">

          Unknown
        </blockquote>

        <p className="mt-10 font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          In a world that demands speed, scalability, and innovation, full stack development is more
          than a technical skill — it&apos;s a strategic advantage. Businesses that embrace this
          model gain flexibility, save time and money, and build better products faster. Whether
          you&apos;re launching a new startup or optimizing an enterprise app, full stack
          development might just be your secret weapon.

          In today&apos;s digital era, businesses are thriving by adopting modern web technologies
          that drive innovation, speed up delivery, and enhance user experience. From JavaScript
          frameworks to AI-powered personalization, the tech stack you choose directly influences
          your company&apos;s agility and competitiveness. Let&apos;s explore how modern web
          technologies are revolutionizing development practices and business outcomes.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
          1. React and Next.js: Building the Modern Frontend
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          React, developed by Facebook, has become a cornerstone of modern frontend development. Its
          component-based architecture allows developers to build complex UIs with reusable pieces,
          making code easier to maintain and test. Next.js, built on top of React, takes this even
          further by offering server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API
          routes—all optimized for performance and SEO out of the box.

    </div>
  )
}`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p className="mb-6">
          The combination of React and Next.js enables developers to deliver highly interactive,
          accessible, and lightning-fast websites. Features like Incremental Static Regeneration
          (ISR) ensure that your site scales without sacrificing freshness or speed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Cloud Services: Scaling Without Limits</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Gone are the days of manual server provisioning. Platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and AWS
          have revolutionized how applications are deployed and scaled. These tools allow teams to
          push changes to production with minimal configuration, while offering features like
          continuous deployment, serverless functions, and global CDN distribution.

            <strong>Netlify:</strong> Excellent for JAMstack and static sites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AWS:</strong> Enterprise-grade scalability and infrastructure.
          </li>

          3. AI-Driven UX: Smarter Interfaces, Happier Users
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Artificial Intelligence is no longer limited to backend data processing. Today, AI
          enhances frontend user experiences by personalizing content, recommending products, and
          predicting user actions. This leads to deeper engagement and increased conversions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Tools like TensorFlow.js and OpenAI&apos;s GPT APIs allow developers to bring machine
          learning directly into the browser. For example, predictive search, auto-tagging content,
          or chatbot integrations can now be embedded with ease.
        </p>

        </pre>

        <p className="mb-6">
          The integration of AI in UX goes beyond gimmicks—it helps streamline decision-making,

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
          4. APIs & Microservices: Extensible and Scalable Architecture
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          REST and GraphQL APIs empower developers to build flexible and decoupled systems. You no
          longer need a monolithic backend. Instead, you can compose your app from multiple
          APIs—whether for payments, content, auth, or analytics.

        <p className="mb-6">
          With the help of platforms like Supabase, Firebase, or Strapi, you can set up backends

      "A step-by-step guide for implementing server-side authentication in modern Next.js (App Router) using Supabase in 2025.",
    content: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Supabase has become one of the most powerful open-source Firebase alternatives. Paired
          with Next.js 13+ App Router, it provides a clean and modern way to manage authentication,
          especially when you&apos;re building server-first applications. In this guide, you&apos;ll
          learn how to set up authentication using Supabase the right way — with SSR, protected
          routes, middleware, and a complete login/signup flow in a production-grade Next.js
          project.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Install Supabase Packages</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          First, install the required Supabase libraries. The core library
          <code className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 bg-gray-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">
            {" "}
            @supabase/supabase-js{" "}
          </code>
          is your connection to the Supabase API, while
          <code className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 bg-gray-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">
            {" "}
            @supabase/ssr{" "}
          </code>
          helps with server-side handling in the App Router.
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg p-4 text-sm mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
          <code>{`npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr`}</code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Set Up Environment Variables</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Create a <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">.env.local</code> file at the
          root of your project and add the following environment variables. These values come from
          your Supabase project&apos;s settings dashboard. Be sure to never expose your service role
          key to the browser.
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg p-4 text-sm mb-6 overflow-x-auto">

          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Create Supabase Utility Clients</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          In a Next.js 13 App Router project, it&apos;s essential to create two utility clients: one
          for the server and one for the client. These allow you to seamlessly call Supabase from
          wherever needed without rewriting the logic. This is especially important for
          authenticated routes.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">utils/supabase/server.ts</h3>

          export const createClient = () => {
            return createServerClient(

        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Middleware to Refresh Sessions</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Since the server cannot refresh tokens (because cookies can&apos;t be mutated in Server
          Components), you&apos;ll need middleware to ensure that session tokens remain fresh.
          Supabase provides a helper to do this automatically.
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg p-4 text-sm mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
          <code>
            {`// middleware.ts
          import { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'
          import { updateSession } from '@/utils/supabase/middleware'
          
          export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
            return await updateSession(request)

            matcher: ['/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
          }`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Build Login & Signup Forms</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Create login and signup forms using Supabase actions inside route handlers. Be mindful to
          use server-side actions and not directly expose Supabase logic to the client unless
          necessary.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">app/login/actions.ts</h3>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg p-4 text-sm mb-6 overflow-x-auto">

          export async function login(formData: FormData) {
            const supabase = createClient()
            const email = formData.get('email') as string

              password
            })

          }`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Protect Private Routes</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          One of the key benefits of SSR in Next.js 13 is that you can conditionally render pages
          server-side based on authentication. Here&apos;s an example that ensures a route is only
          accessible to logged-in users.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">app/dashboard/page.tsx</h3>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg p-4 text-sm mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
          <code>
            {`import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
          import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'
          
          export default async function DashboardPage() {
            const supabase = createClient()
            const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
          
            if (!user) {
              redirect('/login')
            }
          
            return <p className="text-xl">Welcome, {user.email}</p>
          }`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Confirm Signups via Route Handler</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          When email confirmation is turned on (default in Supabase), new users must confirm their
          email address. Supabase sends a confirmation link, and your app should have a route ready
          to receive that token and complete the login.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">app/auth/confirm/route.ts</h3>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg p-4 text-sm mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
          <code>
            {`import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'
          import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
          
          export async function GET(request: Request) {
            const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
            const token = searchParams.get('token_hash')
            const type = searchParams.get('type')
          
            const supabase = createClient()
            const { error } = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({
              token_hash: token!,
              type: type as any,
            })
          
            if (!error) {
              redirect('/dashboard')
            }
          
            redirect('/error')
          }`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Supabase + Next.js 13 App Router is a powerful combination that allows you to build
          secure, server-rendered apps with rich user authentication, fully managed sessions, and
          cookie-based access control — all without the need for external libraries. By following
          the patterns in this guide, your setup will scale gracefully, stay secure, and integrate
          cleanly into your SSR Next.js workflow.

          The Shift from &quot;Just Coding&quot; to Technical Leadership
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Becoming a full stack developer is one thing. Becoming a full stack team lead is another
          game entirely. It&apos;s no longer just about how clean your code is or how many features
          you can ship in a week. It&apos;s about how well you align the team with the business
          vision, how you communicate trade-offs, and how you design systems that are maintainable
          long after the &quot;new project&quot; excitement fades.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          In this article, I&apos;m sharing what I&apos;ve learned moving from solo builder to
          full-time full stack developer and then to dev team lead: the mindset shifts, hard lessons,
          and practical patterns that actually work in real projects.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Owning the Stack, Not Just the Code</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          As a full stack developer, you&apos;re comfortable jumping between frontend and backend:
          React or Next.js on one side, APIs, databases, and cloud infra on the other. As a team lead,
          your responsibility expands: you&apos;re not only shipping features, you&apos;re shaping the
          architecture and ensuring everyone understands it.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li>Choosing the right patterns (monorepo vs polyrepo, microservices vs modular monolith).</li>
          <li>Defining standards for API design, error handling, and logging.</li>
          <li>Keeping performance and security in mind from day one.</li>
          <li>Documenting decisions so the team does not depend on your memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          A good stack is not just &quot;cool tech&quot;. It&apos;s a stack that your current and
          future team can understand, extend, and operate without pain.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Designing Flows, Not Just Features</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          One of the biggest mindset shifts as a lead is zooming out. Instead of thinking in
          individual tickets (&quot;add button&quot;, &quot;connect endpoint&quot;), you start
          thinking in flows:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li>
            How does a new user discover the product, sign up, and get to their &quot;aha&quot; moment?
          </li>
          <li>What data do we need to collect to improve the product using real feedback?</li>
          <li>Where are the sharp edges in the current UX, and how can we remove them?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          As a full stack lead, you&apos;re uniquely positioned: you understand the database,
          business rules, and UI. That means you can design experiences that actually feel coherent,
          instead of a patchwork of disconnected features.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Communication Is Your New Superpower</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          No matter how strong your technical skills are, bad communication can destroy a project.
          Being a team lead means you&apos;re constantly translating:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li>Business goals &rarr; clear technical roadmap.</li>
          <li>Technical constraints &rarr; realistic expectations for stakeholders.</li>
          <li>Complex architecture &rarr; simple diagrams and explanations for the team.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 my-8">
          &quot;If your team doesn&apos;t understand the plan, you don&apos;t have a plan…
          you have a wish.&quot;
        </blockquote>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Great leaders repeat the vision until it&apos;s boring. Then they repeat it again. Alignment
          is not a one-time meeting—it&apos;s a habit.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
          4. Code Reviews: Teaching, Not Policing
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Code reviews are one of your best tools as a lead. But they can either empower the team or
          silently destroy morale. The goal is not to show how much you know; it&apos;s to help
          others grow and keep the codebase healthy.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Good reviews look for clarity, correctness, and consistency. Great reviews also explain the
          &quot;why&quot; behind the feedback. Over time, your team will start catching these issues
          before they even reach review.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Building a Developer Experience (DX) That Scales</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          As projects grow, the friction adds up. Onboarding slows down, builds take longer, and small
          changes feel risky. A full stack lead pays attention to developer experience, not just
          production performance.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li>Clear README and setup scripts (one command to start the project).</li>
          <li>Consistent linting, formatting, and Git hooks.</li>
          <li>Meaningful TypeScript types and helpful error messages.</li>
          <li>Preview deployments for every pull request.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre className="bg-gray-900 text-white text-sm p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
          <code className="whitespace-pre">
            {`// Example: package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p className="mb-6">
          When the DX is good, the team moves faster without burning out. When it&apos;s bad,
          everything feels heavy—even simple tasks.

          6. Mentoring: Multiplying Your Impact
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The real measure of a team lead is not how much they ship personally, but how much the team
          can ship without them. Mentoring is how you multiply your impact.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          That might mean pairing on tricky tickets, helping juniors understand architecture
          decisions, or simply being available for questions without making people feel small for
          asking them. Over time, your job shifts from &quot;doing everything&quot; to
          &quot;enabling everyone&quot;.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Saying &quot;No&quot; (and When to Say &quot;Not Yet&quot;)</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          As a full stack lead, you&apos;re going to be in the room when decisions are made:
          features, deadlines, tech choices, shortcuts. One of the most valuable skills you can bring
          is the courage to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not yet&quot; when something will damage the
          product or the team in the long run.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This doesn&apos;t mean blocking everything. It means offering alternatives:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li>&quot;We can do this quickly, but here&apos;s the tech debt we&apos;re accepting.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;If we cut this feature, we can ship two others on time.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;We don&apos;t need a microservice yet; a well-structured monolith is enough.&quot;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">8. Balancing Hands-On Coding with Leadership</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Many leads struggle with the balance between coding and management. If you code too much,
          you become a bottleneck. If you stop coding entirely, you can drift away from the reality of
          the codebase and the team&apos;s challenges.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          My rule of thumb: stay hands-on, but choose work that unblocks others—spikes, architecture
          prototypes, tricky refactors, or cross-cutting features. Let the team own most of the
          &quot;regular&quot; tickets.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">9. Leading with Transparency and Empathy</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Finally, the human side. Deadlines slip. Bugs hit production. Scope changes at the last
          moment. In those moments, your team is watching how you respond. Blame and panic destroy
          trust. Transparency and calm create it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Share context instead of just tasks. Explain why decisions are made. Admit when something
          was a bad call and how you&apos;ll adjust next time. Protect your team from unnecessary
          chaos, and you&apos;ll earn a level of loyalty that no &quot;team building event&quot; can
          buy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion: Leadership as a Full Stack Craft</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Being a full stack developer in 2025 means more than knowing React, Node, or databases. And
          being a full stack team lead means more than owning the hardest tickets. It&apos;s about
          combining technical depth with clear communication, thoughtful architecture, and genuine
          care for the people you work with.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-10 font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          If you&apos;re on the path from individual contributor to full stack leader, remember this:
          your goal is not to be the hero—it&apos;s to build a team that can ship great products,
          sustainably, with or without you. That&apos;s real engineering leadership.
